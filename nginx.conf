# Minimal Nginx configuration for serving the frontend and proxying the API

server {
    # Nginx listens on port 443, which is the default HTTPS port.
    listen 443 ssl;

    # These files must be provided in the container at /etc/nginx/certs/
    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;

    # This matches any request starting with /api/
    location /api/ {
